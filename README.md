- In below I will list out the 3 Project features ::-

  - OverView Of Homepage ->
    In this project, 
    There is a navbar, banner, and card area on the home page. The navbar's "Home," "Donation," and "Statistics" links are dynamic, which means we can access them at any time. We have a search bar and a button in the banner section; if we use the card category name as our search criteria, the relevant cards will appear. Each card has a dynamic link, which causes us to navigate to another page when we click on any part of the card.

  - Card Details ->
    Each card has a title, a description, and a name of the category. When we click on the card, we will be taken to a different page with a new view that includes a donate button, donation fee, as well as a content title and description. This card is added to the donation page once the donate button is pressed, which causes the button to redirect to the donation page. There are restrictions; for example, each card may only be put to the donation page once and shown a sweet alert, also if we attempt to add it again, the sweet alert will inform us that the same card may not be uploaded more than once.


  - Donation Page Details ->
    Four cards are initially displayed on the donation page. The "see all" button will appear if we add more than or equal to 4 cards. Once clicked, additional cards will emerge and the "see all" button will go. The card info page is returned when we click the view details button. 

  - OverView of statistics page -> 
    The statistics page will display a pie chart based on our donation and total donation amount.  It is simply a statistical depiction of how many donation categories we have and how many times we have donated.
